## Tutorial 2: Creating summary plots

### Introduction
This tutorial will guide you through the procedures to compare groundwater composition provided from overburden wells, completed in sand or gravel aquifers or bedrock wells, completed in a solid rock aquifer, for example in a sandstone or fractured carbonates aquifer. Its aim is to start gaining an understing on a large dataset using plotting.

### Generating a bar chart and customize plot
Select the *Plotting* item from the menu radio buttons. This will generate the default plot type (bar chart) using the first parameter appearing in the parameter list. The bars are grouped by the sampling year and each bar represents the annual average for all measured concentrations. 
Since the set of parmeters is large (over 300), we need to break down the set in subset. The parameters summary table in tutorial 1 revealed, that organic parameters and pesticides were sampled only once for most wells and inorganic and general parameters are sampled yearly. We will therefor filter the paramters to hold only these two groups:

</p>

Note that the parmeter list for the y parameters within the *Plot and axis* section in the sidebar is automatically reduced to inorganic parameters and the bar chart in the viewport is regenerated with alkalinity, which is the first element in the newly filled parameter list. Before generating lists of plots, lets customize the current plot, since this is faster for a single plot than for multiple plots. We perform the following changes: reduce the length of the y axis, so more plots are visible on a page and adding a horizontal line showing the values averall average.

    1 Within *Plot and axis settings* goto *Summary line* and select the *mean* item.
    2 In the same section check the *Define axis length* checkbox and set the y-axis length to 200.

The plot should now look similar to the one below:

</p>

The plot shows, that values show little variation between 200 and 290 mg/l CaCO3 with an average of approximately 240 mg/L. The most prominent change is found between the years 2015 and 2016. A series of identical plots can be generated by setting the `Group plots by` select box to `parameter`. This will generate a seperate plot for each parameter found in the current dataset, which is currently filtered to hold only inorganic and conventional parameters. The viewport is not filled with a plot for each parameter with available data.

</p>

Any result that you would like to keep for your report can be copied to the context menu by clicking on the [...]icon on the upper right of the plot and then select `save as SVG/PNG`. Note that not all parameters have the same sampling frequency and some parameters exhibit a much higher variability than alkalinity. Typically in long time series we observe a reduction of the elements with low concentrations such as chromium. This reduction is not due to anactually observation of lower concentration but due to the reduction of the method detection limit over time: If elements are not detected, their concentration is not necessarily zero, but below the method detection limit. To be able to plot such a value, it generally represented by 50% of the detection limit. Therefore if a concentration in 2000 and 2010 is 0.1 and 0.01 respectively and the true concentration is 0.0001 in both years, the value would be non detected by the laboratory, reported as <0.1 and <0.01 and plotted as 0.05 and 0.005, suggesting a decrease over time.

### Using other plot types and change group by setting
So far changes in concentrations over time have been analysed. To gain a summary view of the data, further grouping of plots can be interesting. In a next step we willcompare bedrock and overburden wells. To accomplish this, simply switch the *Group markers by year* item from year to aquifer type. Note that when plotting multiple plots any click on a control in the sidebar will stop the current process and requild the plots using the new settings. Don't wait to apply corrections until the current process is completed.

When grouping the aquifer type, you find four possible types (bedrock, overburden, N/A and interface) however you only want to compare pure bedrock and overburden wells. This may be achieved by adding bedrock and overburden to the filters in the *Datafilters* section: Add the *aquifer* item to the `Filter data by` select box, a new selectbox named `Filter aquifer types`. The newly created plots only include the two aquifer specified. Note that some elements tend to have higher values in bedrock than overburden, e.g. conductivity, cobalt, hardness, while for other parameters the opposite is true (manganese, lead, iron...).

</p>

Since every bar represents the average over multiple values, but the number of values is not visible, some of apparent differneces may by based on outlier valus in one of the aquifer types, while the bulk of the data may be indeed similar in both aquifer types. To test this hypothesis, you may select the median instead of the average bar aggregation method. You will find that the values will drastically change to lower values in some cases, for example for iron. Next the distribution of water quality parameters may be visualized using other plottypes, each of which can add further insight in the understanding of the dataset. Select histogram from the `Plot type` select box, located in the upper part of the sidebar menu. all barcharts will be transformed in histograms showing the distribution of overburden and bedrock wells. If the distribution of the two populations are fairly well seperated, this configuration maybe useful, however if there is much overlapp, the histograms for both aquifer types overlapp and the plot becomes hard to read. To remedy this, select non from the `Group markers by` select box. This will give a better impression on the overall distribution, however information on the individual distributions of bedrock and overburden wells are lost. You may however achive this again, by generating the plot series twice: one time with only `bedrock` left in the filter, and a second time with *overburden* set in the filter. If you start to be interested in a selection of parameters only and dont want all parameters to be generated with every change you apply to the settings, you may also define *parameter* as a filter from the *Filter data by* select box and then pick the required parameter from the new select box. For the filter defined as below, histograms will be generated for bedrock data only and plots are created for the elements calcium, magnesium, chloride and sodium.
