Welcome to Environmental Data Discoverer (EDE)
==============================================

EDE is a application built with Streamlit that allows analyse environmental data-collections. Data collections is data organized around a common theme and may include several datasets. Data is beeing published commonly as open data. However, preparing this data in order to analyse and make sense of it still takes a lot of expertise and time. In EDE, the information of each dataset is grouped in the following categories:
* general metadata, including a description of the data collection, metadata from and reference to the data owner as well as a summary of the number of samples, parmaeters, stations etc covered by each dataset in the data collection
* summary tables on the station information
* summary tables on the parameters measured 
* a plotting utility, alowing the user to visualize the data using various plot types

Currently EDE includes two datasets, both published by Ontario.ca: 
* Groundwater quality data from the Ontario Monitoring Network
* Surface water quality from the Ontario Surface water Monitoring Network

EDE is designed to allow easy addition of additional data collections.
